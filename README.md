# Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR) Viewer

# Overview

The **Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR) Viewer** is a powerful desktop application designed for visualizing and interacting with medical images in multiple planes, supporting both **DICOM** and **MHD** formats. It provides an intuitive interface for exploring **3D volumes** along with their **2D projections**, offering enhanced diagnostic and research capabilities.

# Features

###  Multi-Planar Viewports
- **Simultaneous Viewports:** Displays **axial, coronal, and sagittal** slices of a 3D volume.
- **3D Model View:** Interactive panel for rendering and manipulating the **3D model**.
- **Real-time Updates:** Synchronizes **slice positions** across all viewports and the 3D model.

###  Navigation Features
- **Slice Scrolling:** Navigate through slices using the **mouse scroll** or **keyboard**.
- **Slice Indication:** Highlights the current slice across all views for better orientation.

###  Image Manipulation
- **Zoom:** Adjust zoom levels using the **scroll wheel** or dedicated controls.
- **Pan:** `Shift + Hold and Drag` to move across the image.
- **Rotate:** `CTRL + Hold and Rotate` for enhanced 3D visualization.
- **Brightness/Contrast Control:** `Hold and Scroll` to fine-tune image clarity.

###  Point Localization
- **3D Volume Point Selection:** Click on a point in any view to see its corresponding **location in all perspectives**.

###  Layout & Controls
- **Four Panels:**
  -  **Axial View**
  -  **Coronal View**
  -  **Sagittal View**
  -  **3D Model View**
- **Slider:** Adjusts slice position dynamically.
- **Reset Button:** Restores views to their **initial states**.
